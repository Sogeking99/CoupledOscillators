# CoupledOscillators
Simulation of movement of coupled oscillators using differential equations for Analysis 4 course. 


User can enter n masses of objects and n+1 strength of elastic threads. Program will generate short animation of those bodies oscillating and then show graph of that movement. For animation is used package VPython, code can work without it and it will still show graph.
